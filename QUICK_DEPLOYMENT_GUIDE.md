## 🚀 **DEPLOYMENT STEPS**

### **1. Deploy Updated Code**
Your latest code is already pushed to GitHub main branch. Just redeploy on Render:

1. Go to your Render dashboard
2. Find your `coal-python-bot` service
3. Click **"Manual Deploy"** → **"Deploy latest commit"**
4. Wait for deployment to complete

### **2. Enable Discord Operations**
Once deployed, enable Discord:

```bash
curl -X POST https://coal-python-bot.onrender.com/nuclear-enable
```

### **3. Wait 5 Minutes**
The bot will now connect to Discord in **5 minutes** instead of 2 hours!

## 📊 **CURRENT STATUS CHECK**

### **Check Bot Status:**
```bash
curl https://coal-python-bot.onrender.com/nuclear-status
```

### **Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "nuclear_mode": true,
  "discord_enabled": true,
  "startup_delay": 300,
  "cooldown_period": 1800,
  "protection_active": false
}
```

## ⏰ **NEW TIMELINE**

### **After Manual Enable:**
- **0-5 minutes**: Protection delay (much faster!)
- **5+ minutes**: Discord bot connects and commands work
- **Auto-role assignment**: Active for new members (ID: 1384141744303636610)

### **If Any Issues:**
- **30-minute cooldowns** instead of 1-hour
- **Faster recovery** from any problems
