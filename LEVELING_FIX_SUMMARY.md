# Leveling System Fix Summary

## Issue
The leveling up message was showing a different level than what appeared in the leaderboard and profile levels. This created confusion for users who would see one level in the level up notification but a different (higher) level in their profile and leaderboard.

## Root Cause
The Discord bot had **inconsistent XP calculation formulas** across different files:

### Before Fix:
- **events.py** (level up messages): Higher XP requirements (200, 300, 500, 1000 multipliers)
- **leveling.py** (leaderboard/profile): Lower XP requirements (130, 195, 325, 650 multipliers - 35% reduction)

This meant that when someone leveled up, the calculation in `events.py` was used (showing lower levels), but when displaying the leaderboard or profile, the calculation in `leveling.py` was used (showing higher levels for the same XP).

## Solution
Standardized the XP calculation formula across **all files** to use the same reduced requirements:

### Files Updated:
- `database.py` - Core XP calculation function
- `cogs/events.py` - Level up message handling
- `cogs/economy.py` - Economy system level calculations
- `cogs/community.py` - Community system level calculations

### New Consistent Formula:
```python
def calculate_xp_for_level(level: int) -> int:
    """Moderately reduced XP requirement per level - easier but not too easy"""
    if level <= 10:
        return int(130 * (level ** 2))  # 35% reduction from original 200
    elif level <= 50:
        return int(195 * (level ** 2.2))  # 35% reduction from original 300
    elif level <= 100:
        return int(325 * (level ** 2.5))  # 35% reduction from original 500
    else:
        return int(650 * (level ** 2.8))  # 35% reduction from original 1000
```

## Result
✅ **Level up messages now match leaderboard and profile levels**
✅ **All parts of the leveling system are now consistent**
✅ **No more user confusion about level discrepancies**

## Impact
- Existing users will not lose any progress
- The standardization uses the easier progression (35% reduced XP requirements)
- All level displays across the bot will now show the same values
- Future leveling will be consistent across all bot features
