# PyMongo Import Error Fix - January 20, 2025

## Issue Description
The Discord bot was experiencing critical failures where all 18 cogs failed to load with the following error:
```
ImportError: cannot import name 'SON' from 'bson'
```

## Root Cause
PyMongo 4.7+ introduced breaking changes in the BSON library structure. Specifically:
- The `SON` class import path was changed
- Internal usage of `bson.son.SON` was replaced with `dict` in PyMongo 4.7+
- This caused compatibility issues with the existing codebase

## Solution Applied
1. **Downgraded PyMongo version** from `>=4.7.1` to `==4.6.3`
2. **Updated requirements.txt** to pin the stable version
3. **Triggered deployment** to apply the fix

## Files Modified
- `requirements.txt` - Changed pymongo version
- `deployment_trigger.txt` - Added deployment trigger
- `PYMONGO_FIX_SUMMARY.md` - This documentation file

## Expected Results After Deployment
- All 18 cogs should load successfully
- Bot should be fully functional
- No more `SON` import errors
- All commands and features should work properly

## Cogs That Should Now Load
1. events
2. moderation  
3. economy
4. leveling
5. cookies
6. community
7. simple_tickets
8. enhanced_moderation
9. settings
10. job_tracking
11. enhanced_minigames
12. dashboard
13. security_performance
14. cool_commands
15. pet_system
16. stock_market
17. backup_system
18. expedition_tickets

## Technical Details
- PyMongo 4.6.3 maintains compatibility with the existing BSON usage patterns
- This version is stable and well-tested
- Future upgrades to PyMongo 4.7+ would require codebase modifications to handle the new BSON structure

## Monitoring
After deployment, verify:
- Bot connects successfully
- All cogs load without errors
- Commands respond properly
- No import-related errors in logs
