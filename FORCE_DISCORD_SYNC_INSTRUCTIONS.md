# 🚨 **FORCE DISCORD SYNC - IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED**

## ✅ **ALL CHANGES ARE PUSHED TO MAIN BRANCH**

**Repository:** https://github.com/THEREALVANHEL/coal-python-bot  
**Branch:** `main`  
**Latest Commit:** `975e846` - FORCE DEPLOYMENT  

---

## 🚀 **IMMEDIATE STEPS TO FORCE SYNC ALL COMMANDS:**

### **Step 1: Restart Your Discord Bot**
```bash
# If using PM2:
pm2 restart coal-bot

# If using systemctl:
sudo systemctl restart discord-bot

# If running manually:
# Stop the bot (Ctrl+C) and restart with:
python3 main.py
```

### **Step 2: Use the /sync Command**
Once your bot is online, immediately run:
```
/sync
```
This will force Discord to register all new commands.

### **Step 3: Wait 2-3 Minutes**
Discord needs time to propagate commands globally. Wait 2-3 minutes after syncing.
