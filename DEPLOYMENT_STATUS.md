## ⏱️ **What Happens Next**

### **If hosting on Render/Heroku/Railway:**
- Bot should **automatically restart** within 2-5 minutes
- Monitor logs for "Bot Online" messages
- All updates will be live after restart

### **If hosting on VPS/Custom Server:**
- May need **manual restart** of bot process
- SSH into server and restart bot service
- `systemctl restart bot-service` or similar

### **Expected Timeline:**
- **0-5 minutes:** Automatic deployment detection
- **2-10 minutes:** Bot restart and reload
- **5-15 minutes:** All commands fully synced in Discord

---

## 🎫 **How to Verify Updates Are Live**

### **1. Test Special Role Access:**
```
Users with role ID 1376574861333495910 should be able to use:
- /ticketpanel (admin command)
- /addxp (admin command) 
- /updateroles (admin command)
- Any other admin/mod commands
```

### **2. Test MEE6-Style Tickets:**
```
Create a ticket and verify:
- Clean, simple welcome embed
- Only 2 buttons: [Claim] [Close]
- Simple welcome message
- No clutter or complex fields
```

### **3. Test Role Updates:**
```
Use /updateroles @user and verify:
- Properly calculates level from XP
- Updates both XP and cookie roles
- Shows clear feedback about changes
```

---

## 🔍 **If Updates Still Not Visible**

### **Check These:**
1. **Bot restart time** - Allow 5-15 minutes for full deployment
2. **Discord cache** - Restart Discord client or wait for cache refresh
3. **Command sync** - Use `/sync` if available to manually sync commands
4. **Server logs** - Check hosting platform logs for restart confirmation

### **Manual Restart Commands (if needed):**
```bash
# On hosting platform dashboard:
# 1. Go to deployment settings
# 2. Click "Restart" or "Redeploy"
# 3. Wait for build/restart to complete

# For VPS/Custom:
sudo systemctl restart your-bot-service
# OR
pm2 restart bot
# OR
docker restart bot-container
```
