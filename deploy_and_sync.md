# 🚀 Deploy and Sync New Commands

## The Problem
Your new commands (`/talktosensei` and `/askblecknephew`) are in the code but not showing in Discord because they haven't been synced yet.

## 🔧 Solutions (Choose One):

### Option 1: Restart Your Bot (Recommended)
1. **Restart your bot** on your hosting platform (Render/Railway/Heroku)
2. The bot will automatically sync commands on startup
3. New commands should appear in Discord within 1-2 minutes

### Option 2: Use Manual Sync Command
1. In Discord, type: `!sync` 
2. This will manually sync all commands (owner only)
3. Commands will update immediately

### Option 3: Force Sync via Hosting Platform
If you have access to your hosting platform console:
```bash
python3 force_sync_commands.py
```

## 📋 New Commands Available After Sync:

### 🤖 AI Commands:
- `/talktosensei` - Chat with wise sensei mentor (renamed from talktobleky)
- `/askblecknephew` - Ask Bleky any question with conversation memory

### 💰 Updated Commands:
- `/atm` - Now visible to all users, buttons expire after use

## ⚡ Quick Fix Steps:

1. **Go to your hosting platform** (Render/Railway/Heroku)
2. **Restart the bot service**
3. **Wait 1-2 minutes**
4. **Check Discord** - new commands should appear

## 🔍 Troubleshooting:

If commands still don't appear:
1. Try `!sync` command in Discord
2. Check bot logs for sync errors
3. Ensure bot has proper permissions
4. Wait up to 5 minutes for Discord's cache to update

## ✅ Verification:
Type `/` in Discord and you should see:
- `/talktosensei` (new)
- `/askblecknephew` (new) 
- `/atm` (updated behavior)
