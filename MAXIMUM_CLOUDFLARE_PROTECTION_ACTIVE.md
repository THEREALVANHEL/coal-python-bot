## 🔧 **MANUAL OVERRIDES** (If Needed)

### **Reduce Protection (Only if no blocks for 24+ hours):**
```bash
export CLOUDFLARE_COOLDOWN=300    # Back to 5 minutes
export STARTUP_DELAY=60           # Back to 1 minute
export MAX_STARTUP_RETRIES=5      # Fewer retries
```

### **Emergency Reset (Use with EXTREME caution):**
```bash
rm -f /tmp/cloudflare_block.txt   # Clear block history
export STARTUP_DELAY=0            # Remove startup delay
# NOTE: This may immediately trigger blocks again!
```

### **Manual Command Sync (When safe):**
Use the `/sync` command in Discord when:
- No Cloudflare blocks for 2+ hours
- Bot is stable and responding
- During low-traffic periods
