# Work Command Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
The work command was not working properly after job selection due to scope issues in the `JobSelectionView` class.

## Root Cause
Two critical scope issues were found in the `job_select` method:

1. **job_stats variable scope issue**: The `job_stats` variable was defined in the outer `work` method but was not accessible inside the `JobSelectionView.job_select` method, causing a `NameError` when trying to access `job_stats["work_streak"]`.

2. **available_jobs variable scope issue**: The `available_jobs` variable was also defined in the outer scope but not accessible inside the view class, causing issues when trying to access `available_jobs[job_index]`.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed job_stats scope issue
- **Before**: `streak_bonus = min(20, job_stats["work_streak"] * 2)`
- **After**: Added `current_job_stats = self.economy_cog.get_user_job_stats(self.user_id)` and changed to `streak_bonus = min(20, current_job_stats["work_streak"] * 2)`

### 2. Fixed available_jobs scope issue
- **Before**: `selected_job = available_jobs[job_index]`
- **After**: 
  - Modified `JobSelectionView.__init__` to accept `available_jobs` parameter
  - Store as `self.available_jobs = available_jobs`
  - Changed to `selected_job = self.available_jobs[job_index]`
  - Updated view instantiation: `view = JobSelectionView(self, interaction.user.id, available_jobs)`

### 3. Added better error handling
- Added try-catch wrapper around the entire `job_select` method
- Added bounds checking for `job_index` to prevent index out of range errors
- Added proper error responses for users

### 4. Added timeout handling
- Added `on_timeout` method to handle view timeouts gracefully
- Added message reference storage for timeout handling
- Disabled view components on timeout with user-friendly message

### 5. Enhanced database connection checking
- Improved database connection validation
- Added better error messages for database issues
- Added debug logging for troubleshooting

## Files Modified
